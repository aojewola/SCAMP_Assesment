This repo contains two different works: The Fibonnaci sequence work and the prediction of titanic survival project on Kaggle

The Fibonnaci sequence codes has a fibonnaci function which takes in any given postive interger and iterative over it to generate fibonnaci sequence.

The prediction of titanic survival project on Kaggle, after training the model and testing, the model achieved 84% accuracy on a public score on Kaggle.
